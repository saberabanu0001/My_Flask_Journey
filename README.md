# My_Flask_Journey

# 🧪 My Flask Journey – By Sabera Banu

Welcome to my personal Flask learning series!  
I'm SABERA, a Python developer and Computer Science student at Sogang University, currently based in Seoul 🇰🇷. This repository documents my day-by-day exploration of Flask—a lightweight yet powerful web framework that’s helping me bridge backend logic with frontend design.

## 🎯 Why I Started This Journey

I’ve worked with Python for years, and I’ve built projects in machine learning and NLP. But I wanted to go deeper into **web development**, especially with Flask, to understand how data-driven applications are built from scratch. This series is my way of learning, reflecting, and sharing.
